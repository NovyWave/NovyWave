## Recent Work & Focus

**Current State:**
- âœ… COMPLETED: Dark/light theme storage system fully functional with proper persistence
- âœ… COMPLETED: Light theme compatibility - all custom components migrated to design tokens
- âœ… COMPLETED: NovyWave UI now works beautifully in both light and dark themes
- âœ… COMPLETED: Fixed all hardcoded colors (40+ instances) replaced with semantic tokens
- âœ… COMPLETED: Signal type unification solved using map_bool_signal pattern from CryptoKick
- âœ… COMPLETED: Claude Code hook system with portable git-based path resolution
- âœ… COMPLETED: Memory MCP debugging and corruption prevention systems
- âœ… COMPLETED: Unified error logging system with duplicate removal and proper architecture
- âœ… COMPLETED: Toast notifications positioned in bottom-right corner following best practices

**Recent Solutions (Don't Repeat):**
- Fixed theme storage by replacing hardcoded "dark" in config.rs save_current_config() with current_theme()
- Solved signal type conflicts using map_bool_signal instead of map_bool+flatten for primary_6()/primary_7()
- Successfully migrated all HSLUV/OKLCH hardcoded colors to NovyUI design tokens (neutral_1-12, primary_6-7)
- Fixed Memory MCP corruption and NDJSON format issues in ai-memory.json
- Theme toggle works perfectly - app switches between light/dark with proper color schemes
- Resolved Claude Code hook path resolution with git rev-parse for contributor portability
- Implemented comprehensive PreCompact/PostCompact backup and recovery system
- Eliminated duplicate error logging by creating single entry point in error_display.rs
- Implemented bottom-right toast positioning with fixed CSS and proper z-index layering
- Added technical_error field to ErrorAlert for dual console/toast output system

**Current Blockers:**
- None - all major systems working correctly

**Essential Daily Patterns:**
- Use map_bool_signal for different signal types, map_bool for simple values (CryptoKick pattern)
- Always use NovyUI design tokens (neutral_*, primary_*) instead of hardcoded colors
- Use IconName enum tokens, never strings for icons  
- Use zoon::println!() for WASM logging, never std::println!()
- Use Height::screen() + Height::fill() pattern for full-screen layouts
- Use git rev-parse --show-toplevel for portable hook paths
- Use error_display::add_error_alert() for ALL error handling - never duplicate logging
- Position toast notifications in bottom-right corner with fixed positioning and proper z-index

**Next Steps:**
- All infrastructure complete - theme system, hooks, memory management, error handling working
- Toast notification system fully functional with bottom-right positioning
- Ready for continued waveform viewer feature development  
- Project infrastructure now production-ready and contributor-friendly
