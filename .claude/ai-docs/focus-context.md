## Recent Work & Focus

**Current State:**
- Working on command system optimization and memory hooks
- All slash commands properly configured and tested
- Hook system redesigned for focused productivity context
- Next focus: Test new Memory MCP entity structure
- Completed focused productivity system implementation
- Updated all documentation to reflect new system
- CLAUDE.md, working-with-claude.md, memory-best-practices.md all updated
- System is now simple, automatic, and reliable as requested

**Recent Solutions (Don't Repeat):**
- Fixed global /tmp pollution by using local .claude/hooks.log instead
- Corrected Memory MCP NDJSON parsing with proper jq syntax for line-by-line processing
- Renamed /store-pattern command to /note for simplicity and clarity

**Current Blockers:**
- None - all systems working properly

**Essential Daily Patterns:**
- Use IconName enum tokens, never strings for icons
- Use zoon::println!() for WASM logging, never std::println!()
- Use Height::screen() + Height::fill() pattern for full-screen layouts
- Always use Width::fill() for responsive design, avoid fixed widths
- Store patterns immediately in Memory MCP after solving bugs

**Next Steps:**
- Test the new focused context generation system
- Verify hook system works with new entity types
- Continue with waveform viewer UI implementation when ready
