## Recent Work & Focus

**Current State:**
- Completed comprehensive PreCompact hook system implementation
- Shared hook infrastructure created with init_hook_env() and update_memory_mcp()
- Simplified Memory MCP commands to single /core-remember-important
- Added proper .gitignore for temporary files while preserving knowledge
- Auto-compaction tested successfully - survival data restored correctly
- System now production ready with clean architecture

**Recent Solutions (Don't Repeat):**
- Fixed code duplication in hooks by creating shared-functions.sh with common utilities
- Simplified Memory MCP from complex /core-archive-* to single /core-remember-important
- Added proper .gitignore for Claude Code temp files while preserving knowledge files
- PreCompact system tested successfully - auto-compaction restored 5 survival patterns

**Current Blockers:**
- None - all systems working properly

**Essential Daily Patterns:**
- Use IconName enum tokens, never strings for icons  
- Use zoon::println!() for WASM logging, never std::println!()
- Use Height::screen() + Height::fill() pattern for full-screen layouts
- Always use Width::fill() for responsive design, avoid fixed widths
- All Claude Code hooks must use shared-functions.sh for project detection and utilities

**Next Steps:**
- Continue with main NovyWave waveform viewer development
- PreCompact system is production ready and tested
- All infrastructure systems optimized and complete
