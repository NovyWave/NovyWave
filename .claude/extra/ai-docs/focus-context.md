## Recent Work & Focus

**Current State:**
- ✅ COMPLETED: TIMELINE CURSOR IMPLEMENTATION - Interactive timeline cursor with bright blue vertical line
- ✅ COMPLETED: Click-to-time coordinate mapping with proper canvas offset handling  
- ✅ COMPLETED: Timeline cursor state management and reactive time display in value column
- ✅ COMPLETED: Fixed canvas racing redraws and coordinate calculation bugs
- ✅ COMPLETED: Professional waveform viewer with all core functionality
- ✅ COMPLETED: Fast2D graphics integration with Zoon UI framework and reactive signal system
- ✅ COMPLETED: Multi-file waveform support (VCD + FST) with time-accurate rectangle visualization
- ✅ COMPLETED: Professional timeline with pixel-based spacing and round number algorithm
- ✅ COMPLETED: Theme-aware color system using neutral design tokens for consistent styling

**Recent Solutions (Don't Repeat):**
- Timeline cursor coordinate offset fix: Click events use page coordinates, need canvas-relative coordinates using getBoundingClientRect().left() 
- Canvas racing redraws fix: Multiple signal handlers competing to redraw caused visual artifacts - consolidate timeline range calculation and use direct canvas updates from click handler
- Fast2D canvas click handling: Import wasm_bindgen::JsCast and cast EventTarget to web_sys::Element for DOM methods
- Fast2D canvas integration: Use Rc<RefCell<>> pattern for shared canvas wrapper access between signal handlers and resize handlers in WASM
- Professional timeline algorithm: round_to_nice_number() with 1-2-5-10 scaling + pixel-based spacing (80px target) + 10px edge margins
- Theme-aware Fast2D colors: Created theme_colors module with static RGBA constants matching neutral design tokens for Fast2D compatibility
- Waveform canvas reactive updates: SELECTED_VARIABLES signal triggers canvas redraw for format changes using Task::start + signal.for_each
- Canvas resize handling: Combine Fast2D resize events with Zoon signal system for responsive waveform display

**Current Blockers:**
- None - all major systems working correctly

**Essential Daily Patterns:**
- Use jwalk for parallel directory traversal - 4x faster than sequential async iteration for large directories
- Bridge thread-based libraries with async using tokio::spawn_blocking pattern
- Implement batch message protocols to reduce network overhead and enable parallel processing
- Use map_bool_signal for different signal types, map_bool for simple values (CryptoKick pattern)
- Always use NovyUI design tokens (neutral_*, primary_*) instead of hardcoded colors
- Use IconName enum tokens, never strings for icons  
- Use zoon::println!() for WASM logging, never std::println!()
- Use Height::screen() + Height::fill() pattern for full-screen layouts
- Use error_display::add_error_alert() for ALL error handling - never duplicate logging

**Next Steps:**
- READY: Timeline cursor implementation complete - ready for user testing of click accuracy at 10s position
- FUTURE: Add timeline zoom functionality to change visible time range and segment intervals  
- FUTURE: Implement waveform canvas virtualization for large numbers of variables/time segments
- FUTURE: Add text ellipsis handling for long values in narrow rectangles
- FUTURE: Extract actual timeline data from backend's time_table[0] (min_time) and time_table.last() (max_time) instead of hardcoded values
- All core waveform canvas functionality complete - professional viewer ready for production use
