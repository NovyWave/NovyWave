### Problem/Context
Complex shell scripts in Makefile.toml tasks were causing cross-platform issues and accidentally killing browser processes instead of just the development server.

### Solution/Pattern
Replaced complex shell scripts with simple, targeted solutions:

1. **Port-based process killing**: Use `lsof -ti:$PORT` to find exact process on configured port
2. **Config parsing fix**: Use `head -1` to get first port match, avoiding redirect port confusion
3. **Graceful shutdown pattern**: TERM signal first, wait 2s, then KILL if needed
4. **Clear user feedback**: Track what was killed with success/failure messages

### Code Example
```bash
# Makefile.toml kill task - cross-platform server shutdown
PORT=$(grep "^port = " MoonZoon.toml | head -1 | cut -d' ' -f3)
PID=$(lsof -ti:$PORT 2>/dev/null || true)
if [ -n "$PID" ]; then
    kill -TERM $PID 2>/dev/null || true
    sleep 2
    kill -KILL $PID 2>/dev/null || true
    echo "Development server on port $PORT stopped"
fi
```

### Impact/Lesson
- **Port targeting is more precise** than process name matching (`pkill -f "mzoon"`)
- **Config parsing needs `head -1`** when multiple lines match the same pattern
- **Graceful shutdown** (TERM → wait → KILL) prevents data loss
- **Simple Makefile.toml tasks** are better than complex slash commands for development workflows

## Session Discovery: 2025-08-14

### Problem/Context
Project had redundant command files (`project-start.md`, `project-stop.md`) that duplicated functionality now handled by simplified Makefile.toml tasks.

### Solution/Pattern
Consolidated development server management into standard Makefile.toml approach:
- `makers start` - Start development server with log redirection
- `makers open` - Start server and open browser
- `makers kill` - Stop all development processes

### Code Example
```toml
# Simplified Makefile.toml tasks
[tasks.start]
script = '''
> dev_server.log
mzoon/bin/mzoon start ${@} >> dev_server.log 2>&1
'''

[tasks.kill]  
script = '''
PORT=$(grep "^port = " MoonZoon.toml | head -1 | cut -d' ' -f3)
PID=$(lsof -ti:$PORT 2>/dev/null || true)
# ... graceful shutdown logic
'''
```

### Impact/Lesson
- **Eliminate duplication** between slash commands and build tasks
- **Standard tooling** (`makers`) is better than custom command systems
- **Documentation consistency** requires updating all references when removing features
- **Simple is better** - removed 100+ lines of complex shell scripting for 10 lines of essential logic
