Distribution strategy via git templates or manual copying.","System improvements checklist: 1) Fix missing YAML frontmatter in core commands 2) Test migration process 3) Create validation tools 4) Add framework detection 5) Expand to React/Vue/Python frameworks 6) Build migration automation 7) Address import path validation 8) Handle core updates distribution","Memory MCP only design: Eliminated tmp files completely. Added session_planning as 6th focused entity for long-form planning and analysis. All planning now persistent and searchable. Smart archiving preserves old planning in archived_planning entity. No more invisible tmp files - everything in Memory MCP.","Checkpoint workflow design: Two-stage commit system with /core-checkpoint (ultra-fast WIP saves that amend to CHECKPOINT) and enhanced /core-commit (analyzes accumulated CHECKPOINT changes to create proper conventional commits). Separates rapid iteration from thoughtful final commits.","Todo capacity management strategy: Move older/low-priority todos from next_steps to incomplete_tasks entity when approaching 5-item limit. Keep next_steps focused on immediate actionable items only. Use incomplete_tasks as backlog for future sessions.","Process management validation strategy: Need comprehensive solution to prevent multiple server instances from corrupting dev_server.log. Current approach kills specific processes but may miss edge cases. Better solution: 1) Port-based detection (kill anything using port 8080), 2) Comprehensive process detection (not just mzoon/makers/backend), 3) Atomic log management (clean slate each startup), 4) Process tree tracking (all spawned processes), 5) Validation after cleanup (verify port free and no conflicts). Consider exclusive locking or unique log files as alternative approaches.","Server cleanup strategy chosen: Working directory based approach using lsof +d . to find backend processes in project directory. Safer than port-based (won't kill browser), simpler than renaming binaries. Need to handle edge cases: 1) lsof availability check, 2) backend might be in subdirectory like target/debug/, 3) multiple backend processes if tests running, 4) permission errors on kill","Designing /core-todos command: Will display tasks from Memory MCP focused entities - next_steps (immediate actions), active_blockers (current issues), incomplete_tasks (backlog), and recent items from completed_tasks (for context). Format: clean CLI sections with emoji indicators, priority markers, and counts. Implementation: read entities via mcp__memory__open_nodes for reliability.","COMPREHENSIVE FILES & SCOPES IMPLEMENTATION PLAN","PHASE 1: Frontend File Selection API","- Use HTML5 File API with input[type=file] element","- Extract only filename, size, MIME type (browsers block full paths for security)","- Send file metadata to backend via MoonZoon Up/DownMsg pattern","- Backend will handle all file loading and parsing","PHASE 2: Backend File Processing Architecture","- Use wellen crate for VCD/FST parsing (supports both formats, multi-threaded)","- Create file storage system in backend/src/files.rs","- Implement Up/DownMsg communication for file operations","- Design file session management for remote/local modes","PHASE 3: TreeView Integration","- Modify TreeView to support single selection mode","- Connect TreeView selection to Variables panel loading","- Implement signal-based file hierarchy display","PHASE 4: Waveform Data Architecture","- Design lazy loading system for variable data","- Create backend API for variable extraction","- Implement efficient data streaming to frontend","REVISED FILES & SCOPES PLAN - 2025 BROWSER APIS","CRITICAL INSIGHT: Cannot send GB-scale files to backend via HTTP","SOLUTION: Use File System Access API for direct file streaming","FILE SIZE HANDLING STRATEGY:","- File System Access API: Stream large files directly from disk","- Fallback: Traditional input for older browsers","- Process files in chunks on backend to avoid memory issues","WELLEN SITUATION RESOLVED:","- Use Martin's wellen fork (new_pub_types branch)","- Fork adds public APIs needed for external usage","- Original wellen is actively maintained (v0.16.1, June 2025)","- Fork is minimal, safe, and still relevant","UPDATED ARCHITECTURE:","- Frontend: File System Access API for file handles","- Send only file metadata + stream chunks to backend","- Backend: Receive chunks, reconstruct, parse with wellen","- Memory management: Process files in chunks, not all at once","CRITICAL LIMITATION DISCOVERED: File System Access API cannot pass file paths to backend!","Browser security prevents path access - only file content available","ARCHITECTURAL DECISION NEEDED:","Option A: Read file content in browser, send to backend (defeats large file purpose)","Option B: Use Tauri-specific file access when in desktop mode","Option C: Backend runs on same machine, use file path via different mechanism","TAURI INTEGRATION INSIGHT:","- Tauri has own file system API separate from browser File System Access API","- Tauri can access file paths directly via Rust backend commands","- Browser mode still limited by web security model","RECOMMENDED APPROACH:","- Browser mode: Traditional file input (with size limits/warnings)","- Desktop mode: Tauri file dialogs + direct file path access","- Backend processes files directly from disk (no transfer needed)","CUSTOM FILE BROWSER SOLUTION RESEARCHED","EXCELLENT OPTIONS FOUND:","Option A: Frontend file manager libraries (Vuefinder, React File Manager, SVAR)","- Vue: Vuefinder, Vuetify File Browser, VueDisk","- React: @cubone/react-file-manager, SVAR File Manager","- Features: drag-drop, multi-select, tree view, backend API integration","Option B: Rust backend file server libraries","- simple-file-server: Minimalist Actix-based file server with REST API","- Spacedrive: Full file explorer with Rust core and virtual filesystem","- BUI Backend: Browser UI with Rust backend integration","- Custom Actix endpoint in our backend for file system browsing","- Frontend file browser component integrated with MoonZoon","- No file transfer needed - just send file paths via Up/DownMsg","- Perfect for GB-scale files - backend reads directly from disk","SIMPLIFIED FILE LOADING APPROACH DECIDED:","PHASE 1: Text input with absolute paths (comma-delimited)","- Use native browser alert/dialog via browsermcp","- Send absolute file paths via MoonZoon UpMsg","- Backend reads directly from disk (no transfer!)","- Perfect for GB-scale files","PHASE 2: Future upgrade options","- Custom Zoon file browser with server communication","- Or integrate Vuefinder/SVAR file manager for inspiration","- LazyLoaded NovyUI TreeView with Up/DownMsg backend","PARALLEL LOADING CONSIDERATIONS:","- Memory: Multiple GB files could consume significant RAM","- CPU: Parsing multiple waveforms simultaneously = high CPU","- I/O: Disk reads for multiple large files","- Benefits: Faster overall loading time","- Solution: Consider queuing or limiting concurrent loads"]}
