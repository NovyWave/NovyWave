Root cause: new implementation sorted 5371 variables on every keystroke (in get_variables_from_selected_scope) PLUS sorted again during filtering.

Root cause was double sorting (5371 variables sorted on every keystroke + filtered subset).

When variables exceed ~12 items (12 * 24px = 288px), the Stack becomes taller than viewport constraint, creating extremely long scrollbar due to height mismatch.","Fixed Variables panel scrollbar length issue in Docked to Bottom mode by removing FILES_PANEL_HEIGHT constraint from Row layout (main.rs:315) and moving height constraint to files_panel_docked() function (views.rs:1448) - resolved virtual list viewport measurement mismatch","Fixed Files & Scopes panel broken layout in bottom dock mode by using correct panel functions - files_panel_with_height() and variables_panel_with_fill() instead of files_panel_docked() and variables_panel_docked()","Bottom dock mode height conflict resolved: Row with Height::fill() + files_panel exact height broke layout, needed proper wrapper containers with Width constraints","Panel function mapping: Right dock uses files_panel_with_height()+variables_panel_with_fill(), bottom dock should use same but with Width::exact_signal for Files and Width::fill for Variables","Completely fixed dock mode layout issues - replaced panel functions in bottom dock with proper wrapper containers using files_panel_with_height() and variables_panel_with_fill() instead of docked variants, resolved height distribution and width constraints, both Right and Bottom dock modes now work perfectly","FINAL FIX: Identified and resolved fundamental layout difference - bottom dock mode was missing wrapper container for selected_variables_with_waveform_panel() causing fixed height to exceed available space and trigger root scrollbar. Added El::new().s(Width::fill()).s(Height::fill()).child() wrapper to match right dock mode structure. All scrollbar issues now completely resolved in both dock modes.","SUCCESS: Three specialized subagents solved persistent scrollbar issue - CSS/DOM analysis found 4-layer nesting, minimal test cases identified views.rs:1150 as source (Selected Variables panel Scrollbars::both()), comprehensive solutions provided 7 fix approaches.

Fast2D requires static colors so implemented theme-aware constants instead of reactive signals.","Phase 9 timeline refinements: Implemented pixel-based spacing algorithm with round_to_nice_number() function using 1-2-5-10 scaling.
