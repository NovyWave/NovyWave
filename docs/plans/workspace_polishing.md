# Workspace Picker Polishing ‚Äì Current Findings

## What Works
- `last_selected` and `recent_paths` are properly serialized into `.novywave_global` whenever a new workspace is chosen.
- The Open Workspace tree renders checkboxes for folders, so workspaces can be selected directly.
- The dialog clears prior selection when it opens (checkboxes are unchecked until the user picks a folder).
- Expanded folders restore from `.novywave_global` on dialog open without injecting defaults; the tree no longer resets to just `/`.
- Cancel, Escape, and clicking outside persist the final picker snapshot (expanded paths + scroll) before closing.

## Outstanding Issues

1. **Picker tree state still volatile (critical)**
   - Even after multiple reloads on 2025-10-22, `.novywave_global` only ever contains the auto-restored entries (`"/"`, `"/home/martinkavik"`); newly expanded folders never persist.
   - Recent instrumentation shows `üõ∞Ô∏è FRONTEND TRACE [expanded_state_snapshot] action=insert ‚Ä¶` firing for each expansion, yet no corresponding `workspace_picker_snapshot` log or backend update follows.
   - We continue to see the backend receive `expanded_paths: []` immediately after dialog restore (`UpdateWorkspaceHistory ‚Ä¶ expanded_paths: []`), indicating an empty payload still wins the race somewhere in the pipeline.

2. **Workspace selection not cleared on dialog open (regression)**
   - Opening the picker shows the previously selected folder still checked despite `clear_selection_relay.send(())`.
   - `SelectedFilesSyncActors` log `config.rs:selected_files clear_selection_relay`, verifying the domain vector is emptied. If the checkbox persists, inspect the tree-view sync to ensure `external_selected_vec` is also cleared.

3. **Single-folder selection enforcement (fixed)**
   - ActorVec now trims selections to a single path (`config.rs:selected push single=<path>`). Manual testing shows checking a second folder replaces the first as expected.

4. **Scroll position persistence missing**
   - `.novywave_global` still lacks `picker_tree_state.scroll_top`. `workspace_history_scroll_actor` now reads from the scroll actor signal after restore completes; combine its behaviour with the snapshot log to ensure we send the latest value.

## Latest Debug Logs
- `üõ∞Ô∏è FRONTEND TRACE [workspace_picker_expand_request]` / `[workspace_picker_collapse_request]`: TreeView requests.
- `üõ∞Ô∏è FRONTEND TRACE [workspace_picker_expanded_applied]` / `[workspace_picker_collapsed_applied]`: actor commits.
- `üõ∞Ô∏è FRONTEND TRACE [workspace_picker_expanded_state]`: snapshot stream; should precede persistence when restoring=false.
- `üõ∞Ô∏è FRONTEND TRACE [workspace_picker_snapshot]`: published payload (expanded paths + scroll).
- `üõ∞Ô∏è FRONTEND TRACE [workspace_picker_selection]`: selection changes (includes expanded set + scroll).
- `üõ∞Ô∏è FRONTEND TRACE [workspace_picker_scroll]`: scroll actor updates during dialog use.
- `üõ∞Ô∏è FRONTEND TRACE [workspace_picker_restore]`: restore lifecycle.
- `frontend/src/config.rs:selected push single`, `‚Ä¶ removed`, `‚Ä¶ clear_selection_relay`: show when selection actors receive clear/select events.
- Backend persistence runs through `UpMsg::UpdateWorkspaceHistory`; watch `dev_server.log` for any errors after the snapshot log fires.
- Keep logs active until persistence works; remove afterwards.

## Latest Snapshot ‚Äì 2025-10-22
- Added `expanded_state_snapshot` traces inside `FilePickerDomain::expanded_directories_actor` to confirm each expand/collapse produces the expected vector.
- `workspace_history_expanded_actor` now remembers the last non-empty vector and skips ‚Äúhidden‚Äù empty updates, yet we still observe empty persistence events immediately after restore.
- Backend merge now ignores empty picker snapshots unless no prior data exists; empty writes have stopped, but new expansions still never reach disk.
- Picker scroll updates are now gated on the picker snapshot being non-empty; no more scroll-only writes of an empty tree.

## Current Hypotheses / Next Tests
1. Restore actor clears selection before the initial non-empty snapshot can publish, causing the first payload to be empty.
2. `workspace_history_expanded_actor` may subscribe after the first `expanded_state_snapshot`; confirm subscription ordering on dialog open.
3. TreeView sync might emit a collapse for every node when the dialog closes, overwriting expanded state with the minimal set.
4. Debounce loop inside `workspace_history_actor` could still flush an older `pending` value (empty) after a new non-empty snapshot arrives; inspect `pending` evolution.
5. Picker snapshot helper relies on `domain.expanded_directories_actor.state.lock_ref()` which may already be cleared by the restore reset.
6. Backend receives the correct non-empty payload but the clamp limit or merge logic drops paths outside the recent workspace list; need to trace `history.clamp_to_limit`.
7. Scroll actor gating may skip updates when expanded paths change; verify scroll + expanded sequences during manual interaction.
8. TreeView UI expansions might not mutate the `IndexSet` if the paths were already inserted during restore; dedupe prevents change detection.
9. Config save relay could be lagging‚Äîensure `workspace_history_update_relay` fires after each new snapshot and reaches the backend.
10. The persisted paths we see (`"/"`, `"/home/martinkavik"`) might be inserted by the initialization actor, hiding the fact that user-driven expansions never make it in; compare logs against manual expand events.

## TODOs
- Capture a full dialog open ‚Üí expand ‚Üí close cycle with the new traces enabled; verify whether `workspace_picker_snapshot` ever logs during manual expansion.
- Inspect `workspace_history_actor`'s `pending` state by adding temporary logs around the debounce loop to confirm it switches from `[]` to the expanded list.
- Validate that the backend‚Äôs `UpdateWorkspaceHistory` handler now only prints non-empty picker snapshots; if any `[]` writes remain, gather the preceding frontend traces.

## Latest Debugging Notes
- Added relay instrumentation (`relay_subscribe`, `relay_send`) and confirmed the expanded-path relay often reports `before=1 after=0` once the picker closes‚Äîsubscribers vanish, so follow-up snapshot calls see `[]`.
- Actor state remains accurate (`expanded_actor_state` logs the full path list) and the new `workspace_picker_tree_state_handle` mirrors that state into config; however, `workspace_history_expanded_actor` still restarts on every reopen and only ever logs `received paths=[]`.
- Snapshot helper now skips empty vectors; backend `UpdateWorkspaceHistory` continues to show `expanded_paths: []`, matching the empty inputs.
- Next session should: (1) keep `workspace_history_expanded_actor` subscribed once at app start (outside the dialog scope); (2) log the result of `config.workspace_history_state` immediately before sending `UpMsg::UpdateWorkspaceHistory`; (3) inspect backend serialization after a non-empty payload is confirmed.
- Dead ends so far: pushing snapshots from the relay before `state.set_neq` (still produced empties) and forcing a snapshot during selection changes (history overwrite persisted empty arrays).

## Parity Attempt With Load Files (latest)
- Copied the Load Files dialog scroll wiring to the Workspace picker:
  - Attach the DOM `scroll` listener on the scroll container in `update_raw_el`, sending `element.scrollTop()` into `workspace_picker_domain.scroll_position_changed_relay`.
  - Restore the saved scroll using `after_insert` (once) and leave the listener active; no polling.
- Expand/collapse persistence now writes only `expanded_paths` (no scroll mutations from that path), preventing scroll resets on folder actions.
- Scroll path now calls only `update_workspace_picker_scroll(..)` (plus `update_workspace_scroll(..)` when a target workspace exists); snapshotting is handled by the standard config saver path.

## Instrumentation Added For Traceability
- DOM event hook: `workspace_picker_dom_scroll` fires when the scroll listener runs.
- History mutations: `workspace_history_mutation` traces both `origin=picker_tree_state` and `origin=picker_scroll` with the pointer and values.
- Debouncer lifecycle: `workspace_history_actor` logs `stage=pending` and `stage=send_debounced` with the values that will be sent.
- Backend confirm: `üîß BACKEND: UpdateWorkspaceHistory` shows the final payload written to `.novywave_global`.

### Log Snippets To Watch
Use these quick filters while testing:
```
rg "workspace_picker_dom_scroll|origin=picker_scroll|workspace_history_actor|UpdateWorkspaceHistory" dev_server.log -n
```

## Findings From Last Runs
- Reset-on-open is resolved; expanded paths restore correctly and `scroll_top` is not overwritten at dialog creation.
- Reset-on-expand was caused by persisting a full picker snapshot on expand; switching to `expanded_paths`-only updates fixed this.
- Scroll still not saving reliably during dialog use in Chrome. Traces show:
  - DOM scroll events are sometimes not followed by a persisted non-zero `scroll_top` in the outgoing debounced history if an `expanded_paths`-only update arrives afterwards.
  - To prevent this, `update_workspace_picker_tree_state` now preserves the previous `scroll_top` when updating `expanded_paths`, so the last write cannot reset it to `0.0`.

## Hypothesis
- Remaining loss of `scroll_top` is due to update ordering within the 250ms history debouncer: a later `expanded_paths`-only update can still supersede an earlier scroll update if the scroll was `0` at the time of expand (e.g., first scroll occurs after expand). Preserving `scroll_top` in `update_workspace_picker_tree_state` should mitigate this by keeping the prior non-zero value.

## Next Session Plan
1. Verify DOM ‚Üí relay ‚Üí actor ‚Üí history path end-to-end by scrolling without expanding, then expanding, then scrolling again; confirm no `scroll_top` regressions in `.novywave_global`.
2. If any regression remains, merge pending states in `workspace_history_actor` instead of wholesale replacement: when a new pending history arrives, retain non-default `picker_tree_state.scroll_top` from the previous pending.
3. Remove remaining debug traces once the end-to-end flow is green.
4. Only if Chrome still drops `scroll` on the container, add a `requestAnimationFrame`-based listener that reads `scrollTop` and compares with the last value before writing (no time-based polling).

## Summary Of Achievements
- Restored picker expanded paths and scroll at dialog open without default injections.
- Prevented scroll reset on expand/collapse by removing snapshot-on-expand and preserving `scroll_top` on `expanded_paths` updates.
- Aligned the scroll event handling with the Load Files dialog implementation.
