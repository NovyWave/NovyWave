# Task 8: Distribution & Cross-Platform Testing

This task prepares NovyWave for release across Linux, Windows, and macOS by ensuring robust bundling, testing, and delivery processes. It includes manual bundling with platform-specific tests (especially for Linux), finalizing versioning and signing procedures along with documentation, setting up an automated release pipeline, and integrating an auto-updater system.


## 8a. Manual bundling and platform-specific testing

### Linux

- `makers install`
- `makers tauri-build`

## 8b. Finalize bundling, versioning, signing, releasing

## 8c. Set up an automated release pipeline with e.g. Woodpecker.

## 8d. Configure and integrate an auto-updater system


# Task 9: Examples, Documentation & Beta Release

This task is dedicated to providing thorough documentation, sample projects, and a public beta release. It involves launching the beta version, developing example projects for multiple hardware description languages (e.g., Verilog, SpinalHDL, Spade, Amaranth), and preparing comprehensive user and API documentation that helps both users and developers get started quickly.


## 9a. Polish & launch the beta release for early adopters

## 9b. Develop example projects for multiple HDLs

## 9c. Create comprehensive documentation (user guides, API docs, tutorials, internal notes)
