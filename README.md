NovyWave is an open-source waveform viewer designed as a modern alternative to GTKWave. 

This cross-platform desktop application is suitable for both professionals and beginners, offering simple installation and a strong focus on user experience. Its goal is to boost productivity and satisfaction among current hardware developers while also attracting new developers and students to the hardware design ecosystem. NovyWave is built on fast and reliable Rust libraries and leverages well-proven web technologies to ensure a consistent look, accessibility, design flexibility, and safe user extensibility via WebAssembly plugins.
